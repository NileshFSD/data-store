: The sender application needs to register or configure the webhook by providing the webhook URL to the receiver application. This is usually done through an API or configuration interface provided by the receiver.

Event Occurrence: In the sender application, a specific event or action triggers the need to notify the receiver application. For example, this could be a new order placed, a user signup, or any other significant activity.

HTTP POST Request: When the event occurs, the sender application constructs an HTTP POST request containing relevant data related to the event. It sends this request to the webhook URL of the receiver application.

Receiver Processing: The receiver application receives the HTTP POST request at its webhook URL. It then processes the data in the request and takes appropriate actions based on the event information received.

Response: After processing the data, the receiver application may optionally send a response back to the sender application to acknowledge receipt or provide additional information.
