A webhook is a mechanism that allows two different systems or applications to communicate with each other in real-time. It enables one application (the sender) to send data or trigger events to another application (the receiver) through HTTP requests. When an event or action occurs in the sender application, it will send an HTTP POST request to a specific URL (the webhook URL) provided by the receiver application.

The term "webhook" is a play on the word "web" and "hook," as it implies that the sender is "hooking" into the receiver's system by providing a callback URL where it can send data or notifications.
