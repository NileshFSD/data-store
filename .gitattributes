Subject: New Device Sign-in: Action Required

Dear [User's Name],

We hope this email finds you well. We wanted to inform you of a recent activity on your account that requires your attention. Our system has detected a sign-in from a device that we don't recognize. While this could be you using a new device, we take account security seriously and want to ensure that it's indeed you accessing your account.

If you initiated this sign-in, please disregard this message. However, if this wasn't you or you are uncertain about this activity, we recommend taking the following steps:

1. **Secure Your Account**: Change your password immediately to prevent unauthorized access. Use a strong and unique password that includes a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.

2. **Review Account Activity**: Log in to your account from a trusted device and review the recent account activity. Check for any unfamiliar actions, changes, or transactions.

3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: If you haven't already, consider enabling two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. This will require a verification code in addition to your password for sign-in.

4. **Contact Support**: If you believe your account has been compromised or if you need assistance, please reach out to our support team immediately.

To proceed with these actions, please visit [website link or app] and log in to your account. If you need any further guidance or have questions, our support team is available to assist you.

We appreciate your attention to this matter. Your account security is of the utmost importance to us, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

Best regards,
